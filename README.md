## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Using the flex property for flex items to adjust their widths to match the design.
- Plan ahead for the design, combine layout settings for both desktop and mobile so that it would be easier when buiding the desktop version when the mobile version finished.
